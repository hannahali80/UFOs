# UFOs Analysis:

1.	Overview of Project: The purpose this project is to use JavaScript application to show results in HTML with ability to apply filters. 

2.	Results: The new webpage has the ability to filter through the data using Date, City, State, Country and Shape. In addition the full data is available under the headings: Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration and Comments. When the filter is used a new table is created to show the results and when the filter is cleared the unfiltered data appears again. 

3.	Summary of one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development: The one drawback of this new design is that the filtered data is shown temporary and when new filter is applied the previous results are deleted. This drawback also provides recommendation to create a new button that can save results when clicked on based on user preference. Another recommendation is to sum or count results based on user preference to draw precise conclusion. This can be done by adding sum function at the end of results or create a button to be able to draw totals.
